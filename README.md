- 👋 Hi, I’m @feijasan, Aka Rodrigo Medeiros. I'm a digital marketing and communications professional, with experience working in Brazil´s most important telecommunication and media corporations for more than 10 years, + 5 years as creative writer/copywriter at traditional & new media agencies in my early career. Master degree in Business Administration @PUC-Rio, post-grad training in Service Marketing @ESPM, several video-making and script-writing courses, Communications B.A., consumer anthropology, philosophy and animation workshops. I have some big projects in my baggage, such as Brasil Telecom + Oi/Telemar merging (2008/09), being responsible, as a part of a larger team, for all web transaction-based integration and deployment from the marketing standpoint. During my time at Oi I was also the primary specialist on a number of content and digital brand planning and visual implementation efforts, including Oi FM, Mundo Oi and Oi Fashion Rio. Most important, during my Management Training post-grad (in-company MBA) our group was responsible for the first phase of a company-wide transition from call-center based CRM to digital, web and mobile base consumer services management, using data-driven information (a company first) to change executive perspective on the subject. A total success, with a new department created to focus on that huge undertaking. My move to the US gave me the opportunity to move sideways, going back to a Marketing & Communications, agency/service provider role. With Globosat and Globo international channels as clients, I was directly responsible for Account Management, Communications production, deployment and analysis, B2B training of our partners, media buying, audience and subscription building campaigns, and consumer research (providing Grupo Globo and Globosat a number of insights for the pre-release efforts of their now fully functional streaming service, Globoplay). Lastly, my most difficult challenge so far: being the primary care giver for my son Tomas, almost 5 yo, which I have been focusing on the last 3 years (primary reason for that decision was the fact that I had a required visa change during that time, which made obtaining a self-sponsored Work Authorization impossible). Without a doubt this was the most demanding, 24/7, year long job I ever had, with the best compensation too: kisses, hugs and a lot of affection.
